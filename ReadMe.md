## Testing....

- documenation form https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests;;
  - smoke test : verifying that a component renders without throwing,
  - shallow rendering: testing some of the output,
  - full rendering: testing component lifecycle and state changes.
- Shallow Rendering :

  - test components in isolation from the child components they render, using shallow() rendering AP
    form Enzyme. To install it, Run
  - npm install --save enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 react-test-renderer
  - yarn add enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 react-test-renderer
  - You can read the Enzyme documentation for more testing techniques. Enzyme documentation uses Chai and Sinon for assertions but you donâ€™t have to use them because Jest provides built-in expect() and jest.fn() for spies.
  - npm install --save jest-enzyme

- React Testing Library :
  - Alternagive or companion go enzyme, you may consider using react-testing-library, is a library for testing react components
    in a way that resembles the way the components are used by end users. it is well suited for unit, integration, and end-to-end
    testing of React components and applications. it works more directly with DOM nodes, and therefore its recommended to use with
    jest-dom for improved assertions....
  - npm install --save @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
  - yarn add @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
